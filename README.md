# Language Selector

#### By Skylan Lew

#### Suggests programming languages based on user input. Project 2 (Javascript and Web Browser)

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Bootstrap
* QMK

## Description

This program starts with an entry page, and shows 5 questions as the start/next button is clicked. Upon clicking the submission button, which takes the place of the next button on the last page, the user is suggested what programming language they should learn based on the questions asked. The suggested languages are: HTML/CSS/JS, C#, Ruby, Rust and Python. Pressing the reset button at any point takes the user back to the entry page and sets the questions to their default value. The reset button can be pressed at any time.

Last project, I was using an Akko Alice Pro. However, the T key stopped working correctly, so I busted out my old Drop Preonic, and made firmware for it, but I used QMK configurator, and I'll rewrite it later. You can view my layout [here](https://github.com/doublespoiler/preonic-firmware). This is the first project written with that keyboard, which is why I wanted to include it :).
